# Command-Line-Interpreter-in-Java
This CLI will allow the user to enter the input through the keyboard. After the user writes the command and presses enter, the string is parsed, and the indicated command executed. The CLI will keep accepting different commands from the user until the user writes “exit”, then the CLI terminates.
